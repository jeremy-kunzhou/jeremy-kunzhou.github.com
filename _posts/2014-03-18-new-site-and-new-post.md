Thanks for github. I don't need to spend $7 on my personal website hosting service.

Later, i will do much more work on github. I have done some actually. Like, `ticketee` for ruby. That is a great practice and fixed a lot of error on book for current version of rails or some gems. Thanks for [jekyll][jekyll-url]. Great blog system.

I am a java guy. So i will try to use simple words to express my feelings:
{% highlight java %}
System.out.println("Hello, github!");
{% endhighlight %}
Next update: I will transfer my post from wordpress to this wonderful land.

Catch you later~
