Congratulations! The TickTee for Android is now on Google Play Store!

Well, that is a big moment for myself. First App For Android.

And also the new feature is here: user could specify the particular day of week you would like to work on your project. The prediction will notify you the daily required progress. That is definitely convenient.

This feature is also available on web app.

Next step, I need to build some layout for specific project like budget, saving or reading book and so forth. Again... It is still on my todo list.

So much work need to do for our robot and bulletproof pos. So this is a late update.

Hope you enjoy the new app [Ticktee For Android][ticktee-url].
