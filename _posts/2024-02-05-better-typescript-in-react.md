## 2 About Typescript in React

I recently watched a video from youtuble called [I Wish I know This About Typescript & React Sooner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yyJbHdt9fw) by CoderOne. The content is intereting and shared some useful repo about TypeScript In React

1. [react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app)
2. [Type Zoo](https://github.com/pelotom/type-zoo)
3. [ts toolbelt](https://github.com/millsp/ts-toolbelt)

I believe, the first website will be very useful for working with TypeScript in the future
