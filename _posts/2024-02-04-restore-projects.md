It's time to restore the glory of my personal site.
In my plan, the following projects need to restore:

1. Ticktee
2. Ticktee for Android
3. Personal Site.

## Ticktee

I have re-deployed Ticktee with full functions supports on Koyeb.
The functions include registration, new project creation and remote project status widget.
The progress bar has been used on my personal site. And it looks amazing.

## Ticktee for android

After upgrade the supporting Android SDK to 30, the app is functional and ready for release in google play.
Unfortunately, the original keystore is lost and i have to call it Ticktee for android 2

## Personal Site

After all, the development environment is ready on my local machine.
The new updates include project page updates, regular blog content and more to come.
