I have started my new rails project about 3 days ago, which could be used to notify your personal project progress via a simple image generated by web app. [TickTee][ticktee-url]

It could auto-generate latest progress chart while loading image via certain url.

It is currently online using Heroku Service. But with simple decoration, it did not accept new user to register it and use it except me. The progress bar has been updated on Project page of my realm supporting by this web app. I will let you know when the service could be public. Have fun.
