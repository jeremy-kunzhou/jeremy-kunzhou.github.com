I am so busy working on the android version.

Quite a lot of features are supported such as easy progress update visually, offline workable, sync record background.

And many more new property are added to project like customized target, init progress, and so on.

I hope these features are welcomed and helpful.

Next step, I need to build some layout for specific project like budget, saving or reading book and so forth.

You could meet the much powerful ticktee soon.
