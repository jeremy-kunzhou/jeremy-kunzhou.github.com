I completely upgraded my realm. More content about my project are added.

The whole website is powered by Bootstrap which is a wonderful layout management tools. During the building of my realm, I reused most of my knowledge about CSS, HTML5. I guess the new look should satisfy me.

From now on, I will start build some Ruby on Rails Application on Heroku. Here is my plan: I will start with a project called TickTee, which is the same name as the one from the book . This is a progress assessment application to help people know their progress for project and notify them to make the milestone. If you miss the milestone, there will be a ticket for you. Just like a Tick Tick.

I know there may be some similar project out there and I will do some research, make a feature list and project plan.

Catch you later~
